      <h2>Security Culture vs Criminal and Terrorist Threats</h2>
      <p>
        It is the advice that Iâ€™ve given to my friends and family. The efficacy
        of the advice is directly proportional to the seriousness with which you
        will adhere to the advice. Your mental and physical preparedness will
        play a critical role in you being able to apply the tactics in real life
        during stressful conditions.

      <h2>Violence - It's Here To Stay</h2>
      <p>
        We studied about the cavemen. They took refuge inside caves to protect
        themselves from the violent wild creatures. But this was only until man
        learnt to intimidate the wild with his controlled violence, in his
        defence.

      <h2>Community Policing.....Need of The Hour - PART I</h2>
      <p>
        We have lost many lives in the recent past to crime committed in public
        spaces. I am terribly bad in beating around the bush and sugar coating
        my advice. However, it must be noted that I am responsible for what I
        write and NOT for how my written is understood or interpreted.

        Insight Into - Close Protection / Executive Protection / VIP Security
      </h2>
      <p>
        There is little difference between the terms mentioned above. In fact
        other terms used for those involved in this form of asset protection is
        - Personal Security Officer (PSO), Close Protection Operative (CPO),
        Personal Security Detail (PSD), Bodyguard, etc... While such a form of
        security was initially meant for heads of state and people of public
        importance, it has now become a common attachment for many.

      <h2>The Fear of Pain: A Powerful Ally in Counter Crime Tactics</h2>
      <p>
        In the world of crime and security, one of the most potent weapons at our disposal is the ability to confront and overcome the fear of pain. 
        This primal instinct, deeply ingrained in our psyche, often serves as a barrier to action, preventing us from taking the necessary steps to protect ourselves and others.
